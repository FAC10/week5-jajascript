architecture

Specs:

- [ ] Use at least 1 API
- [ ] Make your API calls from the back-end using the Request module (or one you build yourself)

- [ ] Your server should contain a minimum of 2 routes

- [ ] We expect back-end testing using tape (test as many components as you can) and basic front-end testing.

- [ ] Test your server by injecting fake HTTP requests using Shot.

- [ ] Host your project on heroku, see resources

- [ ] Use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules.

- [ ] Consider a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week.

- [ ] Employ continuous intergration on your project with Travis or a similar tool.

- [ ] Use CodeCov or a similar tool for test coverage.

- [ ] Display continuous intergration and code coverage badges on your project README.

- [ ] Ensure that errors are handled, if for example a user attempts to make a request to a non-existent route to your server, provide the user with a custom response.
